### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The goal of a kickstarter is most indicative of success in the ranges of 0-14999 and 45000+. Outside of those ranges there is a convergence of the percentage of successfull and failed kickstarters suggesting there are other factors affecting the outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
