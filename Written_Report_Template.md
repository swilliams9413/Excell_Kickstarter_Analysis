# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To illustrate the relationship between a project's outcome and its goals and launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There is a significant spike in successful kickstarters launched in May. It trends downward into December where it converges with the percentage of failed kickstarters. The downward trend incdicates the spike is not the result of a few outliers in the dataset.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The goal of a kickstarter is most indicative of success in the ranges of 0-14999 and 45000+. Outside of those ranges there is a convergence of the percentage of successfull and failed kickstarters suggesting there are other factors affecting the outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I didn't encounter any difficulties creating the charts or when manipulating the data. I could see someone having difficulty creating charts that looked like that examples given if the functions in the added columns were not used properly. For example, if they used the wrong numbers for the percentage of successful kickstarters calculations.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The launch date of a theater kickstarters appears to have a strong relationship with its outcome. However, more data is needed to explain/confirm the correlation. For example, the socio-economic status of donors, their locations, and if the spike is due to predictable circumstances like tax refunds.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There appears to be a weaker correlation between the outcomes and its goal. The relationship appears to only be significant at either end of the data set. The middle of the data set hovers around 50% successful suggesting the goals of the kickstarters may not be the best variable for predictive analysis.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A big limitation is the geographic sorting. If the data included specific cities of the kickstarters the analysis would be more accurate. For example, a kickstarter in New York for a theater production would probably have a greater odd of success than if it were launched in Boca Chica.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
